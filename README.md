#Toddler's battle

##Description
This project is a digital board game for two players. 
The two players are moving on a map (grid) thanks to the keyboard arrows or directly using the mouse.
Weapons (cookies, rainbows, teddy bears) and blocks (cribs) are dispatched on the map.

A block makes a cell inaccessible to a player.
When going through a cell with a weapon, the player leaves his/her current weapon on the cell and retrieves the cell one.
When players are next to each other, a fight to death starts. 
If a player chooses to defend himself at his/her turn, when attacked, he/she will suffer only half his/her enemy's weapon damage.
